## Timeline 

- **Start Date:** September 2023 
- **End Date:** December 2023

## Overview 

The project commenced in September 2023 and successfully concluded in December 2023. It encompassed the creation of secure data lakes on Amazon S3, efficient data ingestion into SageMaker Studio, and comprehensive data exploration using AWS Data Wrangler. Biases were addressed through thorough profiling and SageMaker Clarify. Scaling feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning optimized model performance. The training and evaluation of models on SageMaker Autopilot resulted in the deployment of high-performing sentiment analysis models, continuously monitored for real-time accuracy. The README provides a succinct overview of the project's scope and achievements within this timeframe.
